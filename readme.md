Neural Network Framework Implementation in Python

Introduction
This is a Python-based neural network framework for creating and training artificial neural networks. It provides the flexibility to define, configure, and train custom neural network architectures.

Features
Modular Design: The framework is designed with modularity in mind, allowing you to easily assemble and configure neural network layers.

Activation Functions: A variety of activation functions are available, and you can even define custom ones.

Data Normalization: It includes data normalization methods to ensure stable training.

Training and Testing: The framework supports training your model and testing its accuracy against a test dataset.

Installation
To use this framework, make sure you have Python installed. Clone this repository and install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository_url>
cd neural-network-framework
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Data Preprocessing:

The framework assumes a CSV dataset (e.g., "futebol.csv"). You can adapt the dataset by changing the file path in the code.
Model Configuration:

Define the neural network architecture using the provided layers, activation functions, and their configurations.
Data Normalization:

If necessary, normalize the data to ensure stable training. The code includes an example of data normalization.
Training:

Train your model using the provided training data. You can configure the number of epochs and learning rate.
python
Copy code
model.fit(x_train, y_train, num_epochs, learning_rate)
Evaluation:

Evaluate the model's performance on the training and test datasets to assess accuracy.
Prediction:

Use the trained model for making predictions.
python
Copy code
predicted = model.predict(inputs)
Example
A complete example using the provided dataset is available in the code. You can follow the code structure and customize it for your own data and network architecture.
